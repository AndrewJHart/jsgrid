# jsgrid

Experimental grid built with JavaScript and inspired by Jeet's fraction-based layouts.

### Features
- Rapid development with attributes (never touch a line of CSS)
- Consistently sized nested gutters
- Flexible fractional widths

**[Demo](http://corysimmons.github.io/jsgrid)**

### Why?
Because I'm cool and like tinkering with grid stuff.

### Is this laggy?
Depends on how huge and deeply nested your site is, but for most sites it's really fast and uses minimal JavaScript. Not only that, but in the future, when CSS `attr` has support for more properties, we can port this to pure CSS.

### Browser Support
Horrid.
